        <h1>Project 5: Image Detection and Colour Analysis System</h1>
        <p>I implemented OpenCV for image detection and color extraction, followed by Scikit-learn for data analysis. By visualizing color distribution in images using pie charts, I provided clear insights into both dominant and minor colors, facilitating better understanding and interpretation of image content.</p>
        <p>This project showcases the integration of computer vision techniques with data analysis tools to extract and visualize meaningful information from images, enhancing the ability to interpret and analyze visual data.</p>
