        <h1>Project 3: Arrhythmia Detection in 12-Lead ECG</h1>
        <p>I utilized Python to implement a range of models, including rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning models like CNN, ResNet18, and ResNet50, to detect over 42 types of arrhythmias from ECG data. This approach achieved an impressive 93% accuracy in arrhythmia detection, showcasing the effectiveness of combining traditional rule-based techniques with modern machine learning and deep learning methodologies.</p>
        <p>The project involved a blend of advanced technologies and approaches, including Python for implementation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and deep learning architectures like ResNet18 and ResNet50. These models were critical in enhancing the detection accuracy and reliability of arrhythmia classification from ECG data.</a>
