        <h1>Project 2: Text Processing of Invoices</h1>
        <p>I developed a Donut Model designed specifically for processing text in invoices, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of document image classification and form understanding. By implementing OCR and natural language processing techniques, I improved data extraction speed, leading to a 40% increase in overall productivity through a substantial reduction in manual processing time.</p>
        <p>The project leveraged advanced technologies, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, and transformer-based models. These tools were integral in achieving high accuracy and efficiency in document processing.</p>
