        <h1>Project 1: Intelligent Document Processing</h1>
        <p>We developed an advanced Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) model using the YOLOv8m architecture, incorporating transfer learning techniques. This project involved converting 2D house models into actionable 3D representations, enabling a more immersive and detailed analysis. The model's ability to accurately interpret and transform 2D plans into 3D structures showcases its potential in revolutionizing architectural design workflows.</p>
        <p>Details include the use of OCR, NLP, and various classification algorithms to categorize and extract relevant information from unstructured data.</p>
